# Introduction to Solid

**So**cial **Li**nked **D**ata

MIT DIG / IPRI

http://solid.mit.edu/

https://github.com/solid/solid

## Solid is...

1. A continuation of the vision of the Read-Write Web
2. A toolkit for Linked Data enabled social apps
3. A testbed for decentralized research

---

## The Read-Write Web

A standardized way of Reading and Writing data.

The first ever web browser (Tim's WorldWideWeb) could read and ***edit*** pages.

As web grew, it became *read only* for most users.

---

## The "Read" part of Read-Write Web

![Mission Accomplished](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/34477803.jpg)

---

## The "Read" part of Read-Write Web

Well, sort of...

![Incompatible Auth](incompat_auth.jpg)

Authentication/authorization compatibility still an issue. (Recurring theme.)

---

## The "Read" part of Read-Write Web

Ok, so... we've only solved `HTTP GET` (on public resources). And even then:

* The data is human-readable, but often not machine-readable <br/>
  (see [Intro Linked Data](https://github.com/solid/understanding-linked-data))
* No guarantee that you get what you requested <br/>
  (ask Nicola about authenticated content-addressable data structures...)

---

## The "Write" part of Read-Write Web

It's 2017. What is the state of the art as far as:

*Writing* data on the web? (Generic, inter-operable)

(Out of scope: non-web methods such as SFTP, SSH, SMB, etc)

---

### HTTP POST (Form submit / File upload)

![Form submit](form_submit.png)

* Not very feature rich
* One-off / hand rolled implementations on the server slide

---

### WebDAV (RFC 4918)

![WebDAV](webdav.gif)

**Web D**istributed **A**uthoring and **V**ersioning

* Started around 1999 (finalized in 2007)
* File transfer, collaboration (a more "webby" FTP)
* Mount remote WebDAV file systems in most OSs

---

### WebDAV

HTTP verbs (GET / POST/ PUT / DELETE) plus extensions:
- Collections (create / list directories)
- Concurrency control (lock/unlock)
- Copy / Move
- Properties per resource, in XML. (PropFind/PropPatch)
- Auth: Username+Password, group-based ACLs

Useful for file transfer.

Could be decentralized, but suffers from centralized
authentication and access control subsystems. (Room for improvement!)

---

### AtomPub and co

**Atom:** XML-based format for *web feeds* (successor to RSS).

**AtomPub:** A way to read/write/manage Atom feeds.
- Complex on the server-side. Not easy on client side.

**OData:** Open Data Protocol. Initially by Microsoft, now by OASIS.
- Extension of AtomPub
- Very complex on server side (especially data model)
- *General-purpose querying syntax*
- See also: competing GData (Google Data) protocol

Complex. Not decentralized (again, due to auth/acl).

---

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

* Millions of (slightly incompatible) APIs
* Familiar to most developers
* Great framework support (Ruby on Rails, Dropwizard, Django, Express ...)
* No standardized auth (OAuth2 and OpenID Connect as state of the art)
* No standard data model definition. Though see:
  [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/),
  [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/),
  [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html)
* No standard querying syntax (though see Facebook's GraphQL)

---

### Sidetrack: What is interoperability?

For services to be inter-operable, they will need:

* Auth interop: Understand each other's logins and access controls
* API interop: Understand *how* to get the data (which API endpoints/HTTP verbs)
* Schema interop: Use interoperable data formats and semantics.<br />
  (Either use the *same schemas*, or have *automatic translation*.)

---

### Problems (with current REST landscape)

* Diferent, *special-purpose* APIs everywhere
* No interoperability
* Users have very little control over their data
* Identity tightly coupled with each app / service

---

## Read-Write Web: What have we learned?

1. (decentralized) Authentication/authorization is hard
2. Generic query language for REST (raw SQL doesn't cut it..) - hard.
   *Federated* querying - even harder.
3. Interoperability on the data/schema level is hard.

Easy to do a one-off REST service. Interop - currently nearly impossible.

**We can do better.**

---

## Solid: Easier Read/Write Web

REST API + Linked Data.

* Simple persistence for your linked data (datasets, images, etc)
* "Webization" of the File System: Containers (folders) + Resources (files)
* *Generic* data access API: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE / **PATCH**
* Global (cross-domain) Authentication and Access Control

---

## Solid: Decentralized Social App Toolkit

![Solid Overview](solid_overview.svg)

---

### What is different?

* Apps no longer "run" on dedicated servers
* Users can re-use their identities/logins
* Generic REST API for managing data
* No application logic on the server! (Choice of apps)

---

## Solid Features

#### Portable, decentralized identity

**WebID URLs**: globally unique user names.

**WebID Profiles**: portable user profiles.

---

## Solid Features

#### Decentralized Authentication

Current authentication method: WebID-TLS

Transitioning to: WebID-OIDC

Based on WebID / OAuth2 / OpenID-Connect / PoP (Proof of Possession)

---

## Solid Features

#### Decentralized Access Control

Web Access Control allow per-resource
permissions and data sharing without central authority

See: https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec

---

## Solid Features

#### Generic, inter-operable data representation
Flat graph-based data model (Linked Data). Standard, commonly used schemas /
ontologies.

---

## Solid Features

#### Federated Querying (*in progress*)

See: Daniel's Twinql project (https://github.com/dan-f/twinql)

See: Ruben's Linked Data Fragments powered SPARQL endpoints

---

## Solid Features

#### Social Protocol / Web App Conventions (*in progress*)
Solid Specs will allow devs to perform social media operations such as friends
lists, subscribing, receiving notifications.

## Empowering Users

---

### Current User Pain Points

1. **Account Proliferation** (must register with every site / web app)
2. **Data Lock-In** (data lives with app provider)

    - No control of how your data gets used by provider
    - Data Loss (when app provider gets acquired / closes shop)
    - Social Graph lock-in (re-build your friends list for each provider)
3. **No Interop Between Apps** (API mashups if you're lucky)

---

### Solid - Empowering Users

1. **Reusable Accounts/WebIDs** (register with your pod, log in everywhere)
2. **Data Stays with Users**

    - Similar to desktop apps - the data is yours, your choice of apps
    - User controls who (people, companies, apps) accesses data and how
    - Enables data backup / export
    - Social Graph / Contacts stay with user (in reusable vCard format)
3. **Easier Interop - Apps Can Access Each Other's Data**

---

## Empowering Developers

---

### Current Developer Pain Points

Developing a web app? You'll need to:

1. Provide authentication and user accounts (and account recovery, etc)
2. Provide data storage (external privacy regulations, risk of mass leak)
3. Design/implement/test *yet another* REST API and data model
4. Design/implement/test an access control and authorization model
5. Interop with other app providers' APIs is difficult (and restricted/metered)

---

### Solid - Empowering Developers

Using Solid architecture:

* Users *bring their own* user accounts and storage (just by logging in)
* Data is stored with the user - no expense (or regulatory pressure) for you
* Universal, standardized read-write REST API already provided by the users' pods
* All data protected by a standardized Access Control / authorization model
* Interop much easier - your app can access other apps' data (with user's permission)

You just provide the app logic

## Research Opportunities

---

## Solid: Testbed for Decentralized Research

Research Opportunities:

* Decentralized Identity, Authentication and Authorization
* (ACL-aware) Federated Link-following Querying
* Decentralized Pub/Sub, Search, Feed Aggregation and caching
* High availability personal data stores / replication
* RDF Stores + versioning + encryption

---

## Solid: Testbed for Decentralized Research

Research Opportunities:

* Vocab interop / automated schema migration and conversion
