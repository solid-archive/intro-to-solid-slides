# Introduction to Solid

**So**cial **Li**nked **D**ata

MIT DIG / IPRI

https://github.com/solid/solid

## Solid is...

1. A continuation of the vision of the Read-Write Web
2. A toolkit for Linked Data enabled social apps
3. A testbed for decentralized research

---

## The Read-Write Web

A standardized way of Reading and Writing data.

The first ever web browser (Tim's WorldWideWeb) could read and ***edit*** pages.

As web grew, it became *read only* for most users.

---

## The "Read" part of Read-Write Web

![Mission Accomplished](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/34477803.jpg)

---

## The "Read" part of Read-Write Web

Well, sort of...

![Incompatible Auth](incompat_auth.jpg)

Authentication/authorization compatibility still an issue. (Recurring theme.)

---

## The "Read" part of Read-Write Web

Ok, so... we've only solved `HTTP GET` (on public resources). And even then:

* The data is human-readable, but often not machine-readable <br/>
  (see [Intro Linked Data](https://github.com/solid/understanding-linked-data))
* No guarantee that you get what you requested <br/>
  (ask Nicola about authenticated content-addressable data structures...)

---

## The "Write" part of Read-Write Web

It's 2016. What is the state of the art as far as:

*Writing* data on the web? (Generic, inter-operable)

(Out of scope: non-web methods such as SFTP, SSH, SMB, etc)

---

### HTTP POST (Form submit / File upload)

![Form submit](form_submit.png)

* Not very feature rich
* One-off / hand rolled implementations on the server slide

---

### WebDAV (RFC 4918)

![WebDAV](webdav.gif)

**Web D**istributed **A**uthoring and **V**ersioning

* Started around 1999 (finalized in 2007)
* File transfer, collaboration (a more "webby" FTP)
* Mount remote WebDAV file systems in most OSs

---

### WebDAV

HTTP verbs (GET / POST/ PUT / DELETE) plus extensions:
- Collections (create / list directories)
- Concurrency control (lock/unlock)
- Copy / Move
- Properties per resource, in XML. (PropFind/PropPatch)
- Auth: Username+Password, group-based ACLs

Useful for file transfer.

Could be decentralized, but suffers from centralized
authentication and access control subsystems. (Room for improvement!)

---

### AtomPub and co

**Atom:** XML-based format for *web feeds* (successor to RSS).

**AtomPub:** A way to read/write/manage Atom feeds.
- Complex on the server-side. Not easy on client side.

**OData:** Open Data Protocol. Initially by Microsoft, now by OASIS.
- Extension of AtomPub
- Very complex on server side (especially data model)
- *General-purpose querying syntax*
- See also: competing GData (Google Data) protocol

Complex. Not decentralized (again, due to auth/acl).

---

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

* Millions of (slightly incompatible) APIs
* Familiar to most developers
* Great framework support (Ruby on Rails, Dropwizard, Django, Express ...)
* No standardized auth (OAuth2 and OpenID Connect as state of the art)
* No standard data model definition. Though see:
  [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/),
  [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/),
  [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html)
* No standard querying syntax (though see Facebook's GraphQL)

---

### Sidetrack: What is interoperability?

For services to be inter-operable, they will need:

* Auth interop: Understand each other's logins and access controls
* API interop: Understand *how* to get the data (which API endpoints/HTTP verbs)
* Schema interop: Use interoperable data formats and semantics.<br />
  (Either use the *same schemas*, or have *automatic translation*.)

---

### Problems (with current REST landscape)

* Diferent, *special-purpose* APIs everywhere
* No interoperability
* Users have zero control over their data
* Identity tightly coupled with each app / service

---

## Read-Write Web: What have we learned?

1. (decentralized) Authentication/authorization is hard
2. Generic query language for REST (raw SQL doesn't cut it..) - hard.
   *Federated* querying - even harder.
3. Interoperability on the data/schema level is hard.

Easy to do a one-off REST service. Interop - currently nearly impossible.

**We can do better.**

---

## Solid: Easier Read/Write Web

REST API + Linked Data.

* Simple persistence for your linked data (datasets, images, etc)
* "Webization" of the File System: Containers (folders) + Resources (files)
* *Generic* data access API: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE / **PATCH**
* Cross-domain Authentication and Access Control
* Self-managed decentralized Identity

---

## Solid: Decentralized Social App Toolkit

![Solid Overview](solid_overview.svg)

---

### What is different?

* Apps no longer "run" on dedicated servers
* Users can re-use their identities/logins
* Generic REST API for managing data
* No application logic on the server! (Choice of apps)

---

## Solid Features

##### Portable, decentralized identity
WebID URLs: globally unique user names. WebID Profiles: portable user profiles.

##### Cross-domain Authentication and Access Control
Standards such as WebID-TLS, OpenID Connect, and Web Access Control allow fine
grained permissions and data sharing without central authority.

---

## Solid Features

##### Generic, inter-operable data representation
Flat graph-based data model (Linked Data). Standard, commonly used schemas /
ontologies.

##### Social Protocol / Web App Conventions
Solid Specs allow devs to perform social media operations such as friends lists,
subscribing, receiving notifications.

---

## Solid: Testbed for Decentralized Research

Research Opportunities:

* Decentralized Identity, Authentication and Authorization
* (ACL-aware) Federated Link-following Querying
* Decentralized Pub/Sub, Search, Feed Aggregation and caching
* High availability personal data stores / replication
* RDF Stores + versioning + encryption

---

## Solid: Testbed for Decentralized Research

Research Opportunities:

* Vocab interop / automated schema migration and conversion
* Privacy / data retention policies
* Economics: Decentralized business models?
* Reconciling user privacy and third-party access
* Trust / reputation infrastructure

---

## Solid: Help us re-decentralize the Web

* Provides choices of social apps / service providers
* Encourages healthy competition
* Puts users in control of their own data
* Allows data integration from different sources

---

## Solid: Next Steps

1. Come talk to the Solid team (room G522)
2. Drop in the Solid chat room on Gitter: https://gitter.im/solid/chat
3. Get your own WebID and Solid account at http://databox.me/
4. Read the specs: https://github.com/solid/solid-spec
5. Write some apps: https://github.com/solid/solid-client
